**Margin of Safety**

Margin of safety is the difference between the market price and its intrinsic value. In other words the margin of safety is a "cushion" between the objective vs its speculative value. This "cushion" serves as a hedge against various levels of uncertainty.The greater level of uncertainty, the larger the margin of safety is required.

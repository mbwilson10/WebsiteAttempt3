      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am proud to show you my first attempt at an Amber Beer ( or any beer in general). It took sometime to get familar with the process, but with some luck I was able to complete the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taste is similar to abita, but a little less hoppier and carbonated. I belive I did not mix the primig sugar solutiion evenly throughout the wert, and this could have caused uneven carbonation in my drink. Either way, for a first attempt at the beer making process, I am very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you make something with you hands and time, you just come to appreciate it more. My next batch, which I started a few weeks ago, will be a lightly flavored lime lager. Hopefully it will taste similar to a corona, I guess time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
